- title: "Cutaneous and systemic hyperinflammation drives maculopapular drug exanthema in severely ill COVID-19 patients"
  image: covidMDR.png
  description: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cutaneous findings, some being the result of drug hypersensitivity reactions such as maculopapular drug rashes (MDR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether COVID-19 may impact the development of the MDR.A systemic cytokine storm may promote activation of Mo/Mac and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 patients, which in turn may impact the development of MDR.

  description: This report provides first evidence for the IL-5Rα-blocking antibody benralizumab as a treatment option for severe drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms not responding to first-line treatment; proteomic serum analyses point toward substantial eosinophil- and T cell–related changes induced by the treatment.
