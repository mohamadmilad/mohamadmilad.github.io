  description: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cutaneous findings, some being the result of drug hypersensitivity reactions such as maculopapular drug rashes (MDR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether COVID-19 may impact the development of the MDR.A systemic cytokine storm may promote activation of Mo/Mac and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 patients, which in turn may impact the development of MDR.
